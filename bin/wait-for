# Use netcat to wait for container(s) to accept incoming connections on
# specified port(s). Inject environment variables to customize behavior.

# Args:
#   - An array of at least one "host:port", separated by a space, each in the
#     format container:port
#
#     For example: `postgres:5432 web:443`

# Custom environment variables:
#   WAIT_AFTER: How many seconds to wait after the container:port is accepting
#     incoming connections. Default 0.
#
#   WAIT_ATTEMPTS: How many attempts to wait for the container:port. Default 30.
#
#   WAIT_INTERVAL: How many seconds between attempting to connect to
#     container:port. Default 1.

# Example:
#  docker run --rm -e WAIT_ATTEMPTS=10 mycargus/wait-for postgres:5432 web:443
